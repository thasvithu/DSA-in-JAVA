Insertion Sort Algorithm:

1. Start with the second element (index 1) of the array.

2. Compare the current element with the elements before it.
	-If the current element is smaller, shift the larger elements to the right to make space for the current element.
	-Repeat this process until an element smaller than the current element is found or until the beginning of the array is reached.

3. Insert the current element into its correct position in the sorted region.
	-Place the current element in the position where the comparison in step 2 indicates it should be.

4. Move to the next unsorted element and repeat steps 2-3 until the entire array is sorted.
