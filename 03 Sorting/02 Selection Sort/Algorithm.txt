Selection Sort Algorithm:

1. Start with the entire array considered as unsorted.

2. Find the minimum element in the unsorted region.
	- Iterate through the unsorted region to find the minimum element.
	- Assume the first element is the minimum initially.
	- If a smaller element is found, update the minimum.

3. Swap the minimum element with the first element of the unsorted region.
	- Swap the element at the minimum index with the first element of the unsorted region.
	- The minimum element is now in its correct sorted position.

4. Expand the sorted region by moving the boundary.
	-Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted regions one position to the right.
	-The first element of the unsorted region becomes the next minimum.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire array is sorted.
