Bubble Sort Algorithm:

1. Start from the beginning of the array.

2. Compare the first two elements.
	- If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
	- If not, move to the next pair of elements.

3. Continue comparing and swapping adjacent elements throughout the array.
	- After the first pass, the largest element will be at the end of the array.
	- After the second pass, the second-largest element will be in its correct position.
	- Continue this process for (n-1) passes, where n is the number of elements in the array.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more swaps are needed.
	- If, after a pass, no swaps are performed, the array is considered sorted, and the algorithm terminates.
